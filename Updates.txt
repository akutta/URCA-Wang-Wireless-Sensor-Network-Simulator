	GaussianExposureST -- Single Thread
	GaussianExposureMT -- Multithreaded

	Notes:
		Initially thought that I had slowed down the 
	program a lot when Multithreaded.  However, it is 
	still fast.  

	Already updated MT to increase it's performance; however,
	it will still take a while to finish due to the change 
	in exposure calculation.  Doing 10 subdivisions is massively
	slow.  

5.26.2011
	Fixed bug that caused program to hang.  Only present
	in multithreaded version.
